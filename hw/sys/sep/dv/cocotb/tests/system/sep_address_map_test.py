"""SEP address-map register sweep test (PyUVM).

Intention: prove the CPU-LSU can decode sep_cpu_ctrl and one safe CSR in every
LSU-reachable CSR block (including ABR and the entropy pool), without owning
full CSR bit-bash or dead-space refuse.

Bring-up holds the CPU off. Expected offsets/resets/masks come from
env/sep_reg_meta.py and the ABR / pool seq constants — see sep_address_map_seq.
